# Cloud Data Management System

## Overview

This project is a **scalable, event-driven, and serverless solution** designed as a **cloud data management system** for efficiently managing and analyzing movie data. Leveraging various AWS services, it enhances operational capabilities and responsiveness by automatically notifying users and triggering functions when the number of movie entries exceeds a defined threshold.

---

## Architecture

### AWS Services Used

- **Amazon RDS**: Reliable, scalable database for storing structured movie data.
- **AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: Facilitates real-time notifications for threshold breaches.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes code in a serverless environment, optimizing costs and reducing infrastructure management.

### Architecture Flow

1. **Database Initialization**: Connects to **Amazon RDS** and creates the `movies` table.
2. **Data Ingestion**: Inserts a curated set of movie records.
3. **Data Retrieval**: Fetches and analyzes data using SQL queries.
4. **Threshold Monitoring**: Triggers SNS notifications and Lambda functions upon threshold breaches.
5. **Data Visualization**: Generates plots with Matplotlib to visualize genre distributions and highlight threshold events.

---

## Libraries Used

- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library for creating data plots.
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python to integrate with AWS services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

1. Update the database connection details in the source code:
   - **DB_USER**: Your database username
   - **DB_PASSWORD**: Your database password
   - **DB_HOST**: The endpoint for your RDS instance
   - **DB_NAME**: The name of your database

2. Configure your AWS credentials for Boto3 to access AWS services.

---

## Usage

1. Run the main application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The application will:
   - Connect to the RDS instance.
   - Insert test movie records.
   - Monitor the number of movies and trigger notifications if the count exceeds a set threshold.
   - Generate visualizations of the data.
